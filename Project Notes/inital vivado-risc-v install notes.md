Use an Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS working environment

Install vitis core dev suite (includes vivado)

[Downloads](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis.html)

Deselecting some board options in the intall list can reduce install size.

I needed to have en_US.UTF-8 generated in /etc/locale.gen and run `locale-gen`

When installing vitis is had issues with it getting stuck on 'Generating installed device list'

It requires libncurses.so.5 if you have version 6 installed you can create a symlink following this post: [linux - error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.5: - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42686791)

Or try installing these packages. They may not all be necessary.

`libncurses5-dev, libncursesw5-dev, libncurses5, libtinfo5, libtinfo-dev, ncurses-compat-libs` were mentioned.

bord files are installed at

once installed it did not detect the board to fix this i manualy installed drivers

```bash
cd /<Xilinx Install>/Vivado/2023.1/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers/
sudo ./install_drivers
```

install vivado-risk-v and make sd card and bitstream

I had to replace `python` with `python-is-python3` and remove `libtinfo5` under apt-install in the Makefile.

```bash
sudo apt install git make
git clone https://github.com/eugene-tarassov/vivado-risc-v.git
cd vivado-risc-v
make apt-install
make update-submodules
```

I had to add `<Xilinx Install>/Vivado/2023.1/bin` to PATH

```bash
make CONFIG=rocket64b1 BOARD=nexys-a7-100t bitstream
```

```bash
./mk-sd-card
```

```bash
make CONFIG=rocket64b1 BOARD=nexys-a7-100t flash
```

output:

This did not work tried gui programming

add memory device,ok to program it now, select `workspace/rocket64b1/nexys-a7-100t-riscv.mcs` and ok.

Right click on the FPGA device - Boot from Configuration Memory Device

This failed to boot from memory so i just programmed it directly.

open uart console:

pipx install pyserial

`sudo pyserial-miniterm /dev/ttyUSB1 115200`

you can chek the device by looking at `/dev/`

after directly programming it o got this eero over uart

```
RISC-V 64, Boot ROM V3.6
Cannot mount SD: Not a valid FAT volume
```

solved by reformatting sd card to FAT32 and then re running `./mk-sd-card`
